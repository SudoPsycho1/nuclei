  severity: critical
  description: The Electron Applications framework allows for the possibility of remote
    code execution with cross-site scripting when nodeIntegration is enabled and require('child_process').exec('COMMAND')
    is called.

  metadata:
    impact: The presence of node-integration-enabled in Electron applications can
      lead to remote code execution and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, causing
      significant impact on the security and functionality of the applications.
    recommendation: I highly recommend disabling nodeIntegration in Electron Applications
      to prevent cross-site scripting and remote code execution vulnerabilities.
