  name: Sound4 IMPACT/FIRST/PULSE/Eco <=2.x - Authentication Bypass
  author: r3Y3r53
  severity: high
  description: |
    The application suffers from an SQL Injection vulnerability. Input passed through the 'password' POST parameter in 'index.php' is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and bypass the authentication mechanism.
