id: CVE-2023-40459

info:
  name: Denial of Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager
  author: majidmc2,7h3w4lk3r
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier does not adequately perform input sanitization during authentication, which could potentially result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router functions. ACEManager recovers from the DoS condition by restarting within ten seconds of becoming unavailable.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to DoS the target system.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (4.17).
