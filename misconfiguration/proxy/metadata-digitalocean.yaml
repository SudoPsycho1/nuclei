  metadata:
    impact: The impact of the configuration of the DigitalOcean host as a proxy for
      accessing the instance metadata service could potentially allow significant
      access to the host and infrastructure.
    recommendation: Ensure that access to the metadata service on the DigitalOcean
      host is properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
