  name: Google GCP Metadata Service Check
  author: sullo
  severity: critical
  description: The metadata-service-gcp is a Google GCP feature that allows access
    to the instance metadata service through a configured proxy, potentially providing
    significant access to the host and infrastructure.

    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 9.3
    cwe-id: CWE-441
  remediation: Disable the proxy or restrict configuration to only allow access to
    approved hosts/ports. Upgrade to IMDSv2 if possible.

  metadata:
    impact: The Google GCP metadata service check could have a potentially significant
      impact on the security of the host/infrastructure.
    recommendation: I recommend closely monitoring and restricting access to the metadata-service-gcp
      and Google GCP Metadata Service Check to prevent potential security breaches.
