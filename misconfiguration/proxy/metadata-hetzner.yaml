    Cloud that can grant significant host and infrastructure access through the instance
    metadata service check.

  remediation: Disable the proxy or restrict configuration to only allow access to
    approved hosts/ports. Upgrade to IMDSv2 if possible.

  metadata:
    impact: The impact of this configuration is significant, as unauthorized access
      to the host/infrastructure through the metadata service could lead to security
      breaches and data loss.
    recommendation: I highly recommend disabling the Hetzner Cloud Metadata Service
      Check to prevent unauthorized access to the infrastructure.
