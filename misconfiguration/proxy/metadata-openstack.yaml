  metadata:
    impact: The impact of the configuration of the Openstack host as a proxy for the
      instance metadata service is that it could lead to significant access to the
      host and infrastructure, posing a security risk.
    recommendation: It is recommended to disable access to the Openstack Metadata
      Service Check to ensure the security of the host and infrastructure.
