info:
  name: Image Pull Policy set to Always
  author: princechaddha
  severity: low
  description: Ensures that Kubernetes deployments have the image pull policy set to 'Always', which guarantees the most up-to-date version of the image is used.
  impact: |
    Not setting the image pull policy to 'Always' may cause pods to use outdated versions of images, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the images contain fixes or updates.
  remediation: Update the image pull policy in Kubernetes Deployments to 'Always' to ensure that the latest container images are always used.
