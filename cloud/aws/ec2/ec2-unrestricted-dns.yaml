  name: Unrestricted DNS Access in EC2
  author: princechaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Checks for inbound rules in Amazon EC2 security groups that allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) on TCP/UDP port 53, which can expose DNS servers to potential attacks.
  impact: |
    Allowing unrestricted access to DNS services can lead to DNS spoofing, DDoS attacks, and unauthorized access to internal networks.
  remediation: |
    Restrict the inbound rules for TCP/UDP port 53 in EC2 security groups to known, trusted IPs only. Ensure security group rules are tightly controlled and monitored.
