  name: Unrestricted SSH Access in EC2
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Checks for inbound rules in Amazon EC2 security groups that allow unrestricted SSH access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) on TCP port 22, indicating a security risk by exposing the SSH server to the internet.
  impact: |
    Unrestricted SSH access increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential brute force attacks against the SSH server, compromising the security of the EC2 instances.
  remediation: |
    Restrict SSH access in EC2 security groups to trusted IP addresses or ranges, adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.
