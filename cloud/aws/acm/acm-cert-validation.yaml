  name: ACM Certificate Validation Check
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure ACM SSL/TLS certificates are properly validated during issue or renewal, indicating secure communication channels.
  impact: |
    Lack of validation may allow unauthorized certificates, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks or data breaches.
  remediation: |
    Use AWS ACM for certificate provisioning and ensure domain validation steps are correctly followed for each certificate issued or renewed.
