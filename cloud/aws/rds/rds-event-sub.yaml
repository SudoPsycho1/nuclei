  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure RDS event notification subscriptions are active for database security group events to monitor and react to changes in security configurations.
  impact: |
    Without notifications for security group events, unauthorized changes may go unnoticed, potentially leading to security breaches or data exposure.
  remediation: |
    Enable Amazon RDS event notification subscriptions for relevant database security group events through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
