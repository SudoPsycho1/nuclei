  name: Unrestricted NACL Outbound Traffic
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Checks for Amazon VPC NACLs allowing outbound traffic to all ports, recommending restriction to necessary ports only.
  impact: |
    Potential for data exfiltration or unauthorized access if outbound traffic is not properly restricted.
  remediation: |
    Modify NACL outbound rules to limit traffic to only the ports required for legitimate business needs.
