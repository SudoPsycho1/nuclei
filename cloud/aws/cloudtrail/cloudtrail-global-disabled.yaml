  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure Amazon CloudTrail trails are configured to capture both regional and global API activity for enhanced security and compliance in your AWS account.
  impact: |
    Lacking global event logging reduces visibility across AWS services that operate at the global level, potentially missing critical security and compliance data.
  remediation: |
    Enable global service logging in CloudTrail by creating or updating a trail to include global services. This ensures comprehensive activity monitoring.
