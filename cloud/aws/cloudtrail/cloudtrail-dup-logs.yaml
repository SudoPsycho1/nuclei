  name: CloudTrail Duplicate Log Avoidance
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure CloudTrail logging is configured to prevent duplicate recording of global service events across multiple trails.
  impact: |
    Duplicate log entries can lead to increased storage costs and complicate log analysis and anomaly detection efforts.
  remediation: |
    Configure only one multi-region trail to log global service events and disable global service logging for all other trails.
