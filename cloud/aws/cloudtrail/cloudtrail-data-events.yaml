  name: CloudTrail S3 Data Events Logging
  author: princechaddha
  severity: low
  description: |
    Ensure Amazon CloudTrail trails log S3 data events to monitor object-level operations like GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject.
  impact: |
    Without logging S3 data events, you lose visibility into object-level operations which could help detect unauthorized access or modifications.
  remediation: |
    Enable data event logging in CloudTrail for S3 buckets to ensure detailed activity monitoring and logging for better security and compliance.
