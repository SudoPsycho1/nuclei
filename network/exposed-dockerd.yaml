  name: Docker Daemon Exposed
  author: arafatansari
  severity: critical
  description: The presence of an exposed Docker daemon can allow remote attackers
    to access Docker containers and potentially compromise the host system.
  metadata:
    verified: true
    shodan-query: port:2375 product:"docker"
    impact: The impact of a Docker Daemon Exposed on the network map can be severe,
      as it opens up opportunities for remote attackers to gain access to Docker containers
      and the host system.
    recommendation: It is recommended to secure Docker by ensuring that the Docker
      daemon is not exposed on the network, to prevent unauthorized access to both
      the containers and the host system.
