info:
  name: RSVP and Event Management < 2.7.8 - Unauthenticated Entries Export
  author: Akincibor
  severity: medium
  description: |
      The plugin does not have any authorisation checks when exporting its entries, and has the export function hooked to the init action. As a result, unauthenticated attackers could call it and retrieve PII such as first name, last name and email address of users registered for events.
