    impact: The impact of CVE-2022-45933 on KubeView version 0.1.31 and below is that
      an attacker can exploit an information disclosure vulnerability to gain unauthorized
      control of a Kubernetes cluster and potentially steal sensitive information,

      to mitigate the risk of information disclosure and prevent unauthorized access
      to a Kubernetes cluster.
