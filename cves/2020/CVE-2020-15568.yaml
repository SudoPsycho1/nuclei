  metadata:
    impact: The impact of CVE-2020-15568 on TerraMaster TOS prior to version 4.1.29
      is a severe remote code execution vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute
      arbitrary code with root privileges.
    recommendation: I recommend that TerraMaster TOS be immediately updated to version
      4.1.29 or higher to address the CVE-2020-15568 vulnerability that could allow
      for remote code execution as root.
