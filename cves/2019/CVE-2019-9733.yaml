  metadata:
    impact: The impact of CVE-2019-9733 on JFrog Artifactory 6.7.3 is significant
      as it allows an unauthenticated user to bypass the whitelist of allowed IP addresses
      and assume full control of all artifacts and repositories managed by Artifactory.
    recommendation: I highly recommend updating JFrog Artifactory to the latest version
      as soon as possible to address the admin login bypass vulnerability (CVE-2019-9733)
      and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
