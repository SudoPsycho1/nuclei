  remediation: 'Update to v.0.12.3 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should add automountServiceAccountToken:
    false to the operator-console deployment in Kubernetes so no service account token
    will get mounted inside the pod, then disable the external identity provider authentication
    by unset the CONSOLE_IDP_URL, CONSOLE_IDP_CLIENT_ID, CONSOLE_IDP_SECRET and CONSOLE_IDP_CALLBACK
    environment variable and instead use the Kubernetes service account token.'
