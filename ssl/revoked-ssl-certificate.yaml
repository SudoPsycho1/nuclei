  metadata:
    impact: The impact of a revoked SSL certificate is the inability of the associated
      domain to establish secure communication with clients, leading to potential
      security risks and loss of trust.
    recommendation: It is recommended to promptly revoke any SSL certificate that
      has been compromised or is no longer in use for the corresponding domain.
