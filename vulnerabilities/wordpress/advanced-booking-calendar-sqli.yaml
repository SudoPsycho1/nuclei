  name: Advanced Booking Calendar < 1.6.2 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: akincibor
  severity: critical
  description: The AJAX action abc_booking_getBookingResult, available to both authenticated and Unauthenticated users did not sanitise the calendarId parameter which was then concatenated to a SQL statement, leading an unauthenticated SQL injection issue. This could be used to retrieve information from the database, such as users' hashed password, username and email address.
